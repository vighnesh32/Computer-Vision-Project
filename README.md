# Computer-Vision-Project
File Name and Decription :
1. CW_Folder_PG.zip :
See the dataset in CW_Folder_PG folder. It consists of following files:
- Images
    - Training set (train)
       12271 aligned facial images with basic expression.
    - Testing set (test)
       3068 aligned facial images with basic expression.

- Emotion labels
    - Training set (labels/list_label_train.txt)
       Expression label of each image for training set.
    - Testing set (labels/list_label_test.txt)
       Expression label of each image for testing set.
       
 2. Machine leanrning algorithms trained with their hyperparameters are MLP_HOG, MLP_SWIFT, SVM_HOG, SVM_SIFT and CNN in files name mlp_hog.ipynb, mlp_swift.ipynb, svm_hog.ipynb, svm_sift.ipynb and CNN.ipynb respectively.
 3. test_functions.ipynb - Test file
 4. office.mp4 - Video file
 5. report.pdf - Project report

Sequence of running the codes :
1. Start by opening and running each section individually of the files mlp_hog.ipynb, mlp_swift.ipynb, svm_hog.ipynb, svm_sift.ipynb and CNN.ipynb.
2. Now open and run test_functions.ipynb.
